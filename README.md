Project Title: Harris_FinalProject

How to run my program: To run this program, you must have a Java virtual machine instillation of Java 1.20 or above. You need to compile the code by typing javac Harris_FinalProject.java into the terminal, then type java Harris_FinalProject into the terminal. Then, the program should be able to run.

Short summery/features: This is my final project for COSC 111 that demonstrates my ability of using objects, classes, methods, and basic Java concepts. This program is a Pokémon simulator where you fight against a final boss. The program allows you to either attack the boss by typing 1 into the terminal, or heal your Pokémon by pressing 2 into the terminal. Pressing any other key into the terminal will result in a forfeited turn. Attacks can do anything between 25 and 100 damage, while healing can recover anything between 10 and 300 health. The program keeps running until either you or the boss reaches 0 health remaining. Beating the boss requires a little luck and very good decision-making skills. This program also allows you to name your "Pokémon" and the boss you fight against.
